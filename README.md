      - Group the data by zipcode.
      - Find the median price by each zipcode.
      - The house price lower than the median and condition greater than 3, is a strong suggestion to buy.
     
     2. Once bought, when is the best moment to sell and at what price?
      
      - Group the data by zipcode and season
      - Find the price median by zipcode and season
      - The buy price lower than the price median by season and zipcode adds a 30% increase, that would be the sell price with a profit of 30%.
      - The buy price greater than the price median by season and zipcode adds 10% increase, that would be the sell price with a profit of 10%.
